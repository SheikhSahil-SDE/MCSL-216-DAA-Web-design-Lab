<!-- Session 4: Huffman’s Coding Algorithm -->

Q1 Apply Huffman’s algorithm to construct an optimal binary prefix code for
the letters and its frequencies in the following table.
            Letters     A B I M  S  X Z
            Frequency  10 7 15 8 10 5 2
Show the complete steps.

Q2. Implement Huffman’s coding algorithm and run on the problem instance
of Q1.

Q3 What is an optimal binary tree and Huffman code for the following set of
frequencies? Find out an average number of bits required per character. Show
the complete steps.
    A:15 B:25 C:5 D:7 E:10 F:13 G:9

Q4. A file contains only colon, spaces, new line character and digits in the
following frequency:
colon (80), space (500), new line (110), commas (500), 0 (300), 1 (200), 2
(150), 3(60), 4 (180), 5 (240), 6 (170), 7 (200), 8 (202).
