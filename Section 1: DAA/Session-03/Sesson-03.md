<!-- Session 3 : Task Scheduling Algorithm -->

Q1. Apply a brute force approach to schedule three jobs J1, J2 and J3 with
service times as 5,8,12 respectively. The actual service time units are not
relevant to the problems. Make all possible job schedules , calculate the total
times spent in jobs by the system. Find the optimal schedule (total time). If
there are N jobs , what would be the total number of job schedules?

Q2.Implement the task scheduling algorithm on your system to minimize the
total amount of time spent in the system for the following problem:

                Job Service Time
                1   5
                2   10
                3   7
                4   8

Q3. Consider the following jobs, deadlines and profits. Implement the task
scheduling algorithm with deadlines to maximize the total profits.

                Jobs Deadlines Profits
                1       3       50
                2       4       20
                3       5       70
                4       3       15
                5       2       10
                6       1       47
                7       1       60
