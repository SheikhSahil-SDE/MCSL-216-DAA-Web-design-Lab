<!-- Session 6: Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm -->

Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the single source shortest path
algorithm from different sources to the rest of nodes in the following graph and
show allthe intermediate processes:

Q1 Find the shortest path from A to the rest of vertices

Q2 Find the shortest path from B to the rest of nodes

Q3. Find the shortest path from A to the rest of vertices but there are negative
weights(-8) between G and F and (-3) between F and A
