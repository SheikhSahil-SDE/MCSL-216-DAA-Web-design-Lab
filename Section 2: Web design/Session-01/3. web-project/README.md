## Files Description

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the web page. It includes sections for personal details, an "About Me" section, a timetable in tabular form, a list of favorite movies, books, or TV shows in reverse order, a section for interests and disinterests with images, and interesting facts about neighbors. It links to the CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

- **assets/css/styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the web page, styling the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the HTML elements.

- **assets/js/arithmetic.js**: Contains JavaScript code that performs two-digit arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It exports functions for each operation.

- **assets/js/pattern.js**: Contains JavaScript code that prints numbers in a specific pattern, specifically printing 1 for 1 time, 2 for 2 times, 3 for 3 times, and so on up to 10. It exports a function that generates this pattern.

- **assets/images**: Directory intended to store images used in the web project, such as images representing interests and disinterests.
